## AWS Academy Program  

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, since their establishment in 2016 - when there was a first AWS community meeting on FIT (Faculty of Information Technologies) in Mostar, works actively on premise that Cloud computing trends should be brought closer to students and academic institutions through different activities like bootcamps, lectures - online and in-person. That resulted in interest and engagement of students and academic institutions in the work of AWS community and intensive, improved collaboration in achievement of the primary goal of AWS community - knowledge expansion.

## AWS Student Clubs  

The IT industry is recognizable by being open with their community, unquenchable thirst for knowledge expansion and transfer and assistance to all of those who have certain issues. Different IT communities have sprouted out many open source projects that are used for free in different multi-billion projects. The AWS community in the IT world has been recognized as one of the most active, open and most inclusive ones. Being a part of the AWS community means the possibility to exchange knowledge and experience, but also to meet and connect with different people who share common interest and passion.

In order to bring the AWS community into proximity with students, AWS has started the AWS Cloud Clubs initiative, which provides students with the opportunity to become leaders and help other students to get familiar with AWS and Cloud computing via studentâ€™s club.
