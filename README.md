# AWS Community Bosnia
Welcome to the AWS Community Bosnia web page. This is a place where you can find all the information about AWS Community Bosnia, our events, and our community.  

We aim to spread knowledge about Amazon Web Services and Cloud Computing.

The first AWS User Group in Bosnia was created in early 2016 in Mostar. It was the second AWS group in South-Eastern Europe. Thanks to the work of AWS enthusiasts, in addition to Mostar, two AWS User Groups were created in Sarajevo and Banja Luka. With over 600 members, the AWS community is the largest IT community in Bosnia.

Group activities include:
- conference organizations
- meetups
- online meetups
- workshops
- bootcamps

The speakers are some of the biggest AWS experts from the country, region and the world. Through these activities, the AWS community helps anyone interested in Cloud Computing and AWS to learn, share their knowledge, and achieve certification.

To stay in the loop with our activities, follow the hashtag #AWSBosnia on social media.

## AWS Academy Program  

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, since their establishment in 2016 - when there was a first AWS community meeting on FIT (Faculty of Information Technologies) in Mostar, works actively on premise that Cloud computing trends should be brought closer to students and academic institutions through different activities like bootcamps, lectures - online and in-person. That resulted in interest and engagement of students and academic institutions in the work of AWS community and intensive, improved collaboration in achievement of the primary goal of AWS community - knowledge expansion.

## AWS Student Clubs  

The IT industry is recognizable by being open with their community, unquenchable thirst for knowledge expansion and transfer and assistance to all of those who have certain issues. Different IT communities have sprouted out many open source projects that are used for free in different multi-billion projects. The AWS community in the IT world has been recognized as one of the most active, open and most inclusive ones. Being a part of the AWS community means the possibility to exchange knowledge and experience, but also to meet and connect with different people who share common interest and passion.

In order to bring the AWS community into proximity with students, AWS has started the AWS Cloud Clubs initiative, which provides students with the opportunity to become leaders and help other students to get familiar with AWS and Cloud computing via studentâ€™s club.
